# C language
A few C examples, which demonstrate: 
 * C syntax;
 * How to work with pointers;
 * Build your own relatively fast and efficient `tail` utility;
 * Simple datastructures like Linked list, Doubly linked list (via Bitwise XOR links) and Binary tree.

### Traverse C program memory up and down

Compile:
```shell
$ gcc memory-up.c -o memory-up
$ gcc memory-down.c -o memory-down
```

Run (`Segmentation fault` is OK, since we reach our limits):
```shell
$ ./memory-up
1 0x7ffe272ef9b0 0x7ffe272ef9c9: �
